# üñ•Ô∏è MidWare

An advanced cheat for **Rainbow Six Siege**, specifically designed for the **November 17th Shadow Legacy** build.

This project is split into two components:

- **External Loader**  
  Responsible for DLL injection and applying external-only features that are blocked internally.
- **Internal DLL**  
  Hosts the main CLI menu and all internal memory modifications.

The CLI shows the current status of all toggles (ON/OFF) and updates live as hotkeys are pressed.

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. Compile both the **internal DLL** and the **external loader**, or get them from the Release tab.
2. Launch the loader (`MidWare.exe`) which will:
   - Inject the internal DLL into `RainbowSix.exe`.
   - Initialize shared memory for feature toggles.
3. Use hotkeys in-game to enable/disable features.
4. Exit cleanly using `[NUM0]` or by closing the game.
